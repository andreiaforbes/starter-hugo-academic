I have over 10 years of work experience in the healthcare and life science industry working on Data Analytics projects. In my recent Data Science Certificate program, I redefined my statistical and vizualization skills (R, Python,Tableau and Power Bi), had an introduction to machine learning, data integration, modeling and ETL. I am looking forward to leverage my knowledge and experience into a role as data scientist/analyst.
